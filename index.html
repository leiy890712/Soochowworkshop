	<h4 style="margin-top: 30pt;"> Introduction </h4>

<p class="p2" style="margin-top:-10pt;">		
Since 1997, the idea of holography has been considered as the key to approach the theory of quantum gravity. 
In the past few decades, the progress of understanding holography has been made in both the field theories and the dual gravitational theories. 
Supersymmetry makes many computation exactly calculable and comparable in both sides. 
People have already gained a lot of understandings about gravity from dual field calculation due to supersymmetry. 
The idea of this workshop is to bring people working in various fields together to share the most recent opinion and hopefully make it productive. </p>

<p class="p2">	 This workshop is aimed towards advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and active researchers in the field. 
This is the 15th in a series of Asian Winter Schools that have been organized on a rotating basis among Japan, China, India and Korea. 
We welcome students from all of these participating countries as well as students from outside. 
</p>

<p class="p2">	 
The workshop will be held from August 8th to August 12th, 2022. 
We are aiming to hold this workshop offline and welcome all the participants in person. 
However, due to covid-19 pandemic situation in Soochow city, the workshop might need to hold online if necessary. 
</p>

<p class="p2">	 The 2022 Soochow workshop in High energy physics is generously supported by Soochow University and by the funds of.</p>

<p class="p2">	 The Institute for Advanced Study of Soochow University (SUIAS) is a newly founded research center with the long-term goal in fostering a creative research platform from which young scholars can grow as future academic and technological leaders of China. 
Prof. John Michael Kosterlitz works as the Honorary Dean of the institute.
